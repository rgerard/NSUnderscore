# Introduction
NSUnderscore is a set of categories added to NSArray, NSDictionary, and NSSet. This project is an attempt to bring some of the useful functionality found in [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) to the world of iOS programming. Not every single function has been ported over, as some functions are already implemented on the collection objects.

## NSArray

Start by importing the category:

`#import <NSUnderscore/NSArray+NSUnderscoreAdditions.h>`
